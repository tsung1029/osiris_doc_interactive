This repo contains notebooks that interactively demonstrates simple concepts in PIC codes and OSIRIS in particular.  So far I have made notebooks for:

(1) effects of smoothing and 
(2) the ADK field ionization model.

In the near future I want to make the following notebooks:

(1) binary collisions in OSIRIS and 
(2) tracking spins in OSIRIS.
